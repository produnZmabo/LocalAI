When I want to catch up with the latest news from various sources that I follow, I always use FeedlyReader. It is a simple yet powerful RSS reader that syncs with my Feedly account and displays the most recent stories in a neat card-based layout. Each card shows the headline, the source, the image and a brief summary of the article. I can also customize the swipe shortcuts to perform different actions on each card, such as opening the article in Link Bubble, a floating browser that lets me read while browsing other stories, or marking the article as read and removing it from the list. This way, I can quickly and easily access the news that interest me without leaving the main screen of FeedlyReader.
 
## Notch – Android News Application

FeedlyReader also has a dark mode that I can activate at night or in low-light conditions. It reduces the eye strain and saves battery life by using a black background and white text. I can also adjust the font size and style to suit my preferences and readability.
  
Another feature that I love about FeedlyReader is its offline mode. It allows me to download the full text and images of the articles that I want to read later, even when I don't have an internet connection. This is very useful when I travel or when I'm in areas with poor network coverage. I can also share the articles that I like with my friends via email, social media or other apps.
  
FeedlyReader is a must-have app for anyone who wants to stay updated with the news from their favorite sources in a simple and efficient way. It works seamlessly with Feedly, one of the most popular RSS services, and offers a lot of customization options and features. It is available for free on the Google Play Store, with an optional premium subscription that removes ads and unlocks more functionalities.

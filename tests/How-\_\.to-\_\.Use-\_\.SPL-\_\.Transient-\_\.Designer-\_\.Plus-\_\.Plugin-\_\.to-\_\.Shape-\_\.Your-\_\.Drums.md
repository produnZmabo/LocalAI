# How to Use SPL Transient Designer Plus Plugin to Shape Your Drums
 
If you are looking for a powerful and versatile tool to enhance your drum sounds, you might want to check out the SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin. This plugin is based on SPL's Differential Envelope Technology, which allows you to process the attack and sustain of any audio signal independently of its level. This means you can make your drums punchier, tighter, snappier, or more ringy without affecting their volume or dynamics.

The SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin has two main knobs: Attack and Sustain. The Attack knob lets you amplify or attenuate the initial part of transients, while the Sustain knob lets you amplify or attenuate the tail-end of transients. You can also use the Sidechain Filter to exclude parts of the signal from being processed, such as the low frequencies of a kick drum. This way, you can target specific elements of your drum mix, such as the snare or the overheads.
 
Another feature of the SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin is the built-in soft clip limiter, which prevents digital clipping when you boost the Attack or Sustain knobs. You can also use the Parallel Mix knob to blend in some of the original signal for a more natural sound. The plugin is latency-free and works on stereo tracks as well.
 
To use the SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin, you need to download it from Plugin Alliance and install it on your computer. You can also try a demo version before buying it. The plugin is compatible with most DAWs and supports VST, AU, AAX, and RTAS formats.
 
Here are some examples of how you can use the SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin to shape your drums:
 
- To make your kick drum more punchy and defined, increase the Attack knob and decrease the Sustain knob. You can also use the Sidechain Filter to exclude the low frequencies from being processed.
- To make your snare drum more snappy and tight, increase the Attack knob and decrease the Sustain knob. You can also use the Sidechain Filter to exclude the high frequencies from being processed.
- To make your cymbals more crisp and bright, increase the Attack knob and increase the Sustain knob. You can also use the Sidechain Filter to exclude the low frequencies from being processed.
- To make your tom drums more resonant and ringy, decrease the Attack knob and increase the Sustain knob. You can also use the Sidechain Filter to exclude the high frequencies from being processed.

The SPL Transient Designer Plus plugin is a great tool for shaping your drum sounds without affecting their level or dynamics. You can use it to add punch, snap, crispness, or resonance to your drums with just two knobs. You can also use it to reduce unwanted bleed or ringing from other drums or mics. The plugin is easy to use and works on any audio signal that has transients.
